Hello! I just finished learning the basics of HTML and CSS so I wanted to get some practice in. This is my first-ever challenge on GitHub! Unfortunately, I haven't learned Java Script yet so I couldn't make this website interactive, so here's the design part! I had some trouble trying to fit the background image into the top part of the page, which is why the CSS code for it is messy. I was trying to make the width of the image 100% so that it covers the entire width of the page, at the same time reducing the height so that it fits the model. But doing so made the width of the image shrink and I have no idea why. Any feedback would be appreciated!
